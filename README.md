|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network**           | Kalichain Mainnet (Avalanche Subnet) – Testnet available                         |
| **Chain ID**          | Mainnet: 654 / Testnet: 653 [github.com](https://github.com)                     |
| **Native Token**      | **KALIS** (used for gas fees and governance)                                     |
| **Consensus**         | Proof of Stake (PoS) – Avalanche consensus <br/>(Snowman/Avalanche protocols)    |
| **Virtual Machine**   | EVM (100% Solidity-compatible, smart contract support)                           |
| **Performance**       | Transaction finality ~1-2 seconds, high scalability (thousands of TPS possible)  |
| **Blockchain Explorer** | [explorer.kalichain.com](https://explorer.kalichain.com) (Mainnet & Testnet)   |

KALICHAIN functions as an EVM-compatible blockchain, meaning developers can deploy Solidity smart contracts and use the same tools as on Ethereum. The **KALIS** token is the native currency of the network: it is used to pay transaction fees (gas) and powers the ecosystem’s applications. Chain ID **654** identifies the Kalichain network in wallets and applications (the Testnet uses ID **653**)  
[github.com](https://github.com). Avalanche consensus (PoS) provides Kalichain with a high level of security and high performance without mining, through a network of validators that quickly agree on the ledger’s state.

---

## Architecture

As an Avalanche subnet, Kalichain benefits from the infrastructure and advantages offered by the Avalanche platform:

- **Scalability & Speed**: The Avalanche network is renowned for its high speed and near-instant confirmations (finality in ~1 second)  
  [tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com). By adopting Avalanche consensus, Kalichain can support a high volume of transactions without congestion, ensuring a smooth user experience even during peak activity.

- **Innovative Consensus**: Avalanche uses a metastable consensus mechanism (Avalanche/Snowman protocols) that does not require a single leader, ensuring high Byzantine fault tolerance and robust security. This distributed Proof-of-Stake consensus allows Kalichain to avoid the centralization inherent in its old POA model and to rely on a broader validator network.

- **Subnet Sovereignty**: As an Avalanche subnet, Kalichain remains a sovereign blockchain that defines its own rules, tokenomics, and membership  
  [build.avax.network](https://build.avax.network). The Kalichain subnet can choose its validators and configure its characteristics (e.g., fee structure, block size) while enjoying the interoperability of Avalanche’s multiverse.

- **Ecosystem Interoperability**: Integration with Avalanche facilitates interactions between Kalichain and other networks. Bridges can be more easily established between Kalichain and Avalanche’s C-Chain or other subnets, enabling cross-chain token and asset exchanges. Additionally, Kalichain is compatible with Avalanche-supporting wallets (such as Core, Ledger, etc.), as well as MetaMask.

- **Proven Infrastructure**: By migrating to Avalanche, Kalichain leverages Ava Labs’ robust toolkit, documentation, and support. The choice of Avalanche also provides better visibility for Kalichain in the crypto community, as Avalanche is a recognized and reliable L1 network  
  [tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com). This transition has been supported by the Avalanche “Retrograde 9000” (R9000) program that fosters promising new subnets  
  [tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com).

In summary, the Avalanche architecture provides Kalichain with a modern technical foundation offering speed, security, and interoperability, allowing it to focus on its use cases (NFT certification, marketplace, etc.) without compromising network performance.

## History

- **Project Origins (2021-2022)**: The Kalichain concept was developed by the French company Kalissa to address issues of counterfeiting and lack of transparency in luxury and collectible products. The initial ambition was to “tokenize” physical goods via NFTs and guarantee their authenticity using a dedicated blockchain. Technical development led to creating an Ethereum fork blockchain under Proof of Authority (PoA) using Geth (Go Ethereum)  
  [github.com](https://github.com). This first version of Kalichain used a Clique (PoA) consensus with a few authorized validators and adopted Chain ID **654** from the network genesis  
  [github.com](https://github.com).

- **Launch of Kalichain v1 (2023)**: Kalichain launched its mainnet in 2023, marking a key milestone with the deployment of **KALICERTIF**, the NFT-based certification service. An ICO took place at the end of 2023 to support the ecosystem’s development, allowing investors to acquire KALIS tokens and participate in the project’s growth  
  [globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com). During this period, Kalichain set up its dedicated block explorer and published its whitepaper detailing its vision. Late 2023 saw the emergence of the first strategic partnerships and the listing of KALIS on exchange platforms (MEXC, etc.), providing liquidity for the token.

- **Ecosystem Expansion (2024)**: In 2024, Kalichain enriched its application ecosystem. The Kalissa brand began selling certified products on Kalichain, showcasing the blockchain’s utility to consumers. The **KalisWallet** digital wallet was launched (browser extension and mobile) to let users easily manage their KALIS and certification NFTs. In parallel, the development of **KALISMARKET** (marketplace) and **KALISHARE** (real-asset tokenization platform) progressed. Kalichain’s community grew, with thousands of users joining the official Telegram and Discord. International deployment initiatives were undertaken, particularly in Africa, through local partnerships to use KALICERTIF against counterfeit goods.

- **Transition to Avalanche (2025)**: A major turning point came in early 2025 as Kalichain joined the Avalanche ecosystem by becoming a subnet. This strategic migration, announced in February 2025, was accompanied by Kalichain’s entry into the Avalanche R9000 program that supports new L1 networks  
  [tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com). The move to Avalanche brought significant infrastructure improvements (enhanced scalability, security, and broader compatibility) and marked a new era for Kalichain  
  [tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com). Technically, the network shifted from a proprietary PoA consensus to a decentralized Avalanche consensus. RPC endpoints and the Chain ID remained unchanged (ensuring continuity for existing dApps and wallets), but the old PoA nodes were replaced by Avalanche nodes. This migration occurred with no major service interruption thanks to close coordination between the Kalichain team and Ava Labs.

- **Future Steps (2025+)**: After repositioning on Avalanche, Kalichain plans to further decentralize the network by expanding the validator set (possibly via a future KALIS staking mechanism). The 2025 roadmap includes the official launch of **KALISMARKET** (marketplace for NFT-certified physical products) and the implementation of on-chain governance to involve the community in decisions. Ongoing improvements to **KALICERTIF** are planned (integration of AI for fraud detection, royalties for creators upon resales  
  [globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com)) as well as expanding use cases to other sectors (art, official documents, etc.) and new industrial partnerships. The roadmap also anticipates a potential move to open source and increased collaboration with external developers, supported by the Kalichain Foundation established to guide the project over the long term.

## Usage

This section explains how to use Kalichain in practice, whether you’re a user wanting to interact with the network through MetaMask or a developer looking to deploy contracts.

### Adding Kalichain to MetaMask

To interact with Kalichain via a wallet like MetaMask, you must add the network manually (or automatically through a service like Chainlist):

1. **Manual Addition**:  
   - Open MetaMask and choose “Add Network.”  
   - Enter the following Kalichain Mainnet details:
     - **Network Name**: Kalichain Mainnet  
     - **New RPC URL**: `https://mainnet.kalichain.com` (public RPC endpoint)  
       [github.com](https://github.com)
     - **Chain ID**: 654  
     - **Symbol**: KALIS  
     - **Block Explorer**: `https://explorer.kalichain.com`  
   - Confirm to save the network. You can now select Kalichain in MetaMask and view your KALIS balance (make sure you import the KALIS token if needed).

2. **Chainlist**:  
   - Kalichain is listed on Chainlist.  
   - Go to Chainlist, search for “Kalichain,” then click “Add to wallet” for MetaMask to automatically add the correct RPC and Chain ID  
     [github.com](https://github.com).  
   - Confirm the addition in MetaMask.

> **Note**: The Kalichain Testnet can be added similarly using the RPC URL `https://testnet.kalichain.com` (or via Chainlist by enabling “Include Testnets”). The Testnet Chain ID is 653. The Testnet allows experimentation without using real funds.

### Interacting with the Blockchain

Once Kalichain is added to your wallet, you can:

- **Send and Receive KALIS**: Like any crypto, you can transfer KALIS tokens to Kalichain addresses (same format as Ethereum, starting with `0x…`). KALIS transactions will appear on the Kalichain explorer.

- **Check the Explorer**: Use the Kalichain explorer to follow network activity. You can search for transactions, addresses, or blocks. The explorer provides detailed information (hash, sender, receiver, gas, etc.) for each transaction, ensuring full transparency.

- **Use Kalichain dApps**: Connect your MetaMask (set to Kalichain) to the various decentralized apps in the ecosystem. For instance, on **KALISMARKET**, you can purchase products paying in KALIS, and on **Kalissa.io** you can verify the NFT certificates linked to products.

- **Get KALIS**: To acquire KALIS tokens (on the Mainnet), you can use exchanges (e.g., MEXC) or decentralized platforms supporting KALIS. Once purchased, transfer them to your Kalichain address (using the correct Kalichain network or a bridge if the exchange issues KALIS on a different chain). You will then use KALIS as “fuel” for transactions on Kalichain. On the Testnet, you can get test KALIS for free via the faucet (available on request from the community, or through third-party services like Thirdweb’s integrated faucet  
  [thirdweb.com](https://thirdweb.com)).

- **Use Other Wallets**: Since Kalichain is EVM-compatible, you can also use any wallet that supports custom Ethereum networks (e.g., Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet) by entering the Kalichain RPC/ChainID settings.

---

## Development

Kalichain provides a complete EVM environment, allowing developers to leverage standard Ethereum tools to create and deploy decentralized applications on this network. Below are a few starting points:

- **Remix IDE**: You can deploy a Solidity smart contract to Kalichain directly from Remix. In Remix, select the “Injected Provider” environment (your MetaMask must be connected to Kalichain). Then compile your contract and deploy it as you would on Ethereum. The deployment transaction will be submitted through MetaMask and mined in a few seconds on Kalichain.

- **Hardhat/Truffle**: Configure your project to include the Kalichain network. For example, with Hardhat, add an entry in `hardhat.config.js`:
  ```js
  networks: {
    kalichain: {
      url: "https://mainnet.kalichain.com", // Kalichain RPC
      chainId: 654,
      accounts: [ process.env.PRIVATE_KEY ] // your private key for deployment
    }
  }
  ```
  Then use:
  ```
  npx hardhat run --network kalichain scripts/deploy.js
  ```
  to deploy your contracts to Kalichain. A similar approach applies to Truffle (define a Kalichain network in `truffle-config.js` with ID 654 and the RPC URL).

- **Avalanche Tools**: As an Avalanche subnet, Kalichain can also be managed with Avalanche tools. For example, you can use **Avalanche-CLI** to manage a Kalichain node or set up a local blockchain. However, for contract deployment and dApp development, the standard Ethereum approach (Web3.js, Ethers.js, Hardhat, etc.) remains the simplest, given full EVM compatibility.

- **RPC & Web3 Calls**: To interact with Kalichain via code (Node.js backend, Python scripts, etc.), use the usual Web3 libraries while pointing to the Kalichain RPC URL. For example, with **web3.js** in JavaScript or **Web3.py** in Python, simply use the HTTP provider at `https://mainnet.kalichain.com`. All methods (sending transactions, calling read-only functions, etc.) work the same as on Ethereum.

- **Debugging and Tools**: You can use Truffle Dashboard, Hardhat Monitor, or even block explorers to debug your contracts on Kalichain. Remix’s debugger also works to trace transactions on this network.

- **Important Notes**: Be sure to adapt gas settings if needed. Kalichain may have different gas per block limits (see the technical characteristics table). However, in most cases, standard gas estimation from the tools will work fine. Gas costs in KALIS remain affordable in fiat terms (similar to Avalanche or Polygon in cost).

In short, development on Kalichain is nearly identical to an Ethereum experience, significantly reducing the learning curve for newcomers. Developers can leverage their existing Web3 skills to build innovative dApps on Kalichain.

## Governance

Kalichain’s governance is designed to actively involve the KALIS token community in guiding the project. Eventually, the governance model will be based on the following principles:

- **Governance Token (KALIS)**: KALIS is not just a utility cryptocurrency, it also grants voting rights. Holders of KALIS can take part in strategic decisions about the blockchain. The more KALIS a user holds (staked or simply in an eligible wallet), the greater their voting power, ensuring that decisions reflect everyone’s stake in the ecosystem.

- **Improvement Proposals (KIP – Kalichain Improvement Proposals)**: Kalichain will adopt a community-driven proposal system, similar to Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Any community member can submit a KIP describing a technical change (network parameters, protocol updates) or an initiative (foundation fund usage, new partnerships, etc.). Proposals are openly discussed (on Discord/Forums) and then put to a vote.

- **On-chain/Off-chain Voting**: Initially, governance votes may be held off-chain via Snapshot (taking snapshots of KALIS holdings at a certain block, and weighting votes accordingly). In the medium term, as the Avalanche subnet evolves, Kalichain plans to implement an on-chain voting system, where token holders vote directly through a signed transaction on Kalichain, enhancing transparency and traceability of decisions.

- **Scope of Governance**: KALIS holders will have a say in various matters, including network upgrades (protocol changes, gas fees, technical evolutions), usage of the token reserves or treasury funds for funding development or audits, adding new validators, major partnerships, and any decision impacting the ecosystem. For example, the decision to migrate Kalichain to Avalanche could have been subject to a community advisory vote to validate the direction.

- **Kalichain Foundation & Council**: Alongside the community, a non-profit Kalichain Foundation supervises project development. Composed of key team members and advisors, it acts in Kalichain’s best interests. Over time, governance may elect certain members of the Governance Council or approve appointments, ensuring that the Foundation remains aligned with KALIS holders’ interests. The Foundation also maintains transparency by publishing regular project and financial reports.

- **Transparency & Democracy**: All votes and results will be made public. Kalichain is committed to evolving toward increasingly decentralized governance, where the community plays a leading role. The process will be iterative and pragmatic, learning from other DAO and subnet experiences.

In short, KALIS holders play a central role in governing Kalichain: as “co-managers” of the network, they contribute to shaping its development, thus reinforcing the project’s open and community-driven nature. This participatory governance ensures Kalichain remains true to its mission and adaptable to challenges, while remaining accountable to its users.
